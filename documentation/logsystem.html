	<p>Log system will save the data into a .csv file for further analysis.</p>
	
	<p>All the data logged are shown in the log widget. Every a hundred rows around, 
	The program will clear the table and auto-save it into log_temp.csv under temp folder.
	If the program crash, you can recover most of the data from log_temp.csv, 
	but the last dozens of rows without having been auto-saved will be gone.</p>
	<p><b>Note: </b>when the program restart, log_temp.csv will be deleted. 
	So if you are trying to recover data from this file, <b>DO NOT</b> restart the program!</p>
	<br/>
	
	<p>Clicking "Save as" button will save the data temporarily stored in log_temp.csv into the file you specify.</p>
	<br/>
	
	<p>Clicking "Clear and Restart" button will clear the data temporarily stored in log_temp.csv and start a brand new log.</p>
