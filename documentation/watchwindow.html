	<p><center><h1>Watchwindow help</h1></center></p>
	
	<p>Watchwindow not only shows the value of all selected points, but also controls the corresponding operations of each point in oscilloscope and log system.</p>
	<br/>
	
	<p><h1>Name column</h1></p>
	<p>Show the names of points. The name is formed by channel name + "_" + point name to distinguish same points from different channels.</p>
	<p><b>Note: </b>Clicking the name will bolder the corresponding curve in oscilloscope and bring it to the very front.</p>
	<br/>
	
  <p><h1>Value column</h1></p>
	<p>1. Show the real-time value of this point. If the value is changed, the background will be yellow. If 500 ms has passed and value 
	is not changed, the background color will be changed back to normal.</p>
	<p>2. Double-clicking the cell can enter the editing mode. The user can change the value of this point, press enter or somewhere else 
	can quit the editing mode and send the value to transmission plugin. The plugin will handle the concrete send job.</p>
	<p><b>Note: </b>"NA" means the value is invalid. Write "NA" to the cell will set this point value invalid. 
	All values are "NA" when first time instantiated. </p>
	<p>"CL" means the point is "comm loss". Not all plugins support this.</p>
	<br/>
	
	<p><h1>Curve color</h1></p>
	<p>Change the color of the corresponding curve if visible in Oscilloscope. Clicking the button will open the pallet. The number show the corresponding RGB value.</p>
	<br/>
	
	<p><h1>Scope</h1></p>
	<p>Check/uncheck will set the corresponding curve visible/invisible in Oscilloscope</p>
	<p><b>Note: </b>If unchecked, all curve data will be lost. The curve will begin at the time when checked instead of zero x-axis.</p>
	<br/>
	
	<p><h1>Curve Gain and Offset</h1></p>
	<p>The Y value of curve in Oscilloscope = real value * Curve Gain + Curve offset. </p>
	<br/>
	
	<p><h1>Log</h1></p>
	<p>Check/uncheck will begin/stop logging the datas of this point</p>
	<br/>
