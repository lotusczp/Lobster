  <p>
  Lobster is a general purpose debug/test tool. It do the transmission work using plugins. All points can be manipulated by Lobster Script.
  (see <a href="./documentation/script.html">Lobster Script</a> for details)
  </p>

	<p>
	This page gives a typical use case for Lobster. It will satisfy normal usage. 
	Please check the documents of seperate modules for details.
  </p>
  
  
  <p><h1>Setup channels</h1></p>
  <p>click <b>Tools->Channel Manager</b> to open the channal manager window as follows. </p>
  
  <p><center><img src="./documentation/images/channelmanager.png" /></center></p>
  
  <p>Each channel requires a configuration file for its points and the corresponding transmission plugin.(see <a href="./documentation/plugins.html">plugins</a> for details)
  For example, we add a channel named "Var" for UC800 evox/var transmission:
  </p>
  
  <p><center><img src="./documentation/images/addnewchannel.png" /></center></p>
  
  <p><b>Note: </b> The channel name should be unique. But the configuration file and plugin can be used for mutiple channels. 
  For example, we can create a new channal named "Var2" using exact the same "EvoxVar_RTAF.xml" and "EvoxPlugin.dll". 
  The plugin can create mutiple instances if loaded mutiple times.</p>
  
  
  <p><h1>Select the points</h1></p>
  
  <p>If the plugin and configuration file is loaded correctly, we can open <b>Settings->Select Data</b>to see all the supported points.</p>
  
  <p><center><img src="./documentation/images/selectdata.png" /></center></p>
  
  <p>You can add/remove points you care by double click the point name, or by the four buttons. In this example, we chose "add all".</p>
  
  <p>All the selected points are added to the watchwindow</p>
  
  <p><center><img src="./documentation/images/watchwindow.png" /></center></p>
  
  
  <p><h1>Configure the channel if necessary</h1></p>
  
  <p>Click the <img src="./documentation/images/settingsbutton.png" /> to see if this channel need any configurations. This configuration is 
  typically related to hardware. For example, the channels using Evox plugin need to configure the server ip and port(can not be empty). 
  The channels using IMC plugin need to configure the serial port stuff such as prot number and baudrate.</p>
  
  <p><center><img src="./documentation/images/settingswidget.png" /></center></p>
  
  <p><b>Note: </b>Clicking "OK" button here can not close the widget, since other channels still waiting to be configured. It just
  comfirm the configuration of this single channel. If you need close this widget, clicking the <img src="./documentation/images/close.png" /> will do.</p>
  
  
  <p><h1>Start/Stop transmission</h1></p>
  
  <p>By Clicking the <img src="./documentation/images/startbutton.png" />, all channels, no matter which transmission it relies on, are started. 
  Each transmission runs in a seperate thread. Once clicked, the start button will change to pause button, it can be used to pause all the 
  transmission. "Pause" means the plugin no longer exchange data with Lobster main program but the hardware resource (serial port, etc.) it occupies are not 
  released. Use "Stop" button <img src="./documentation/images/stopbutton.png" /> to completely stop all transmissions and release 
  all occupied resource.</p>
  <p>see <a href="./documentation/mainwindow.html">main window</a> for details.</p>
  
  
  <p><h1>Commonly used operations</h1></p>
  
  <p>Double click the "value" cell in the watch window can change the value if this point is writable. </p>
  <p>Check/Uncheck in the "Scope" cell can show/unshow the curve of this point in oscilloscope. </p>
  <p>Check/Uncheck in the "Log" cell can log/unlog the values of this point into a log file. (see <a href="./documentation/logsystem.html">Log system</a>) </p>
  <p>For more operations of watchwindow, see <a href="./documentation/watchwindow.html">Watch window</a> for details.</p>
  <br/>
  
  <p>To change the value of Max Y and Min Y and click "set value" can change Y axis of oscilloscope. </p>
  <p>To change the time range can change X axis of oscilloscope. </p>
  <p><b>Note: </b>Time range can only be changed by mouse wheel or UP/DOWN key. </p>
  <p>For more operations of oscilloscope, see <a href="./documentation/oscilloscope.html">oscilloscope</a> for details.</p>
  <br/>
   
  <p><h1>Script system</h1></p>
  <p>Benefit from Qt framwork, Lobster support the ECMAScript scripting language, as defined in standard ECMA-262. The script is like 
  Javascript and can manipulate the system as well as the points.</p>
  <p>By Clicking the <img src="./documentation/images/scriptide.png" /> can open the script IDE. 
  See <a href="./documentation/script.html">script system</a> for script APIs.</p>
