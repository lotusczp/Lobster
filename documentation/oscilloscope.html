	<p>Oscilloscope shows the curves of all points selected to show in scope.</p>
	<p>The curve line will be dot line if the current value of this point is invalid.</p>
	<p>The oscilloscope will continuously draw current value until the value is changed.</p>
	<p><b>Todo: </b> The oscilloscope are now using openGL to render but the algorithm is not optimized. So if the time range is too big, 
	the cpu usage will be high. We need more effects to improve the drawing algorithm.</p>
	<br/>
	
	<p>To change the value of Max Y and Min Y and click "set value" can change Y axis of oscilloscope. </p>
	<br/>
  <p>To change the time range can change X axis of oscilloscope. </p>
  <p><b>Note: </b>Time range can only be changed by mouse wheel or UP/DOWN key. </p>
  <br/>
  
  <p>Click on the oscilloscope screen, drag and drop, to do this will zoom in the screen to see more details.</p>
